## Codebase Patterns
- This project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/postcss` - no tailwind.config.js file needed
- Design tokens are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using CSS custom properties in `:root` and `@theme inline`
- Must use Node.js 20+ for builds: `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node@20/20.19.5/bin:$PATH"`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Uses Next.js 16 with React 19
- Slate color palette maps to navy tones (slate-900 = #0f172a navy)

## 2026-01-09 - US-001
- What was implemented: Centralized design token system in globals.css
- Files changed: `src/app/globals.css`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind v4 uses `@theme inline` directive instead of tailwind.config.js
  - Color palette defined as CSS custom properties in `:root` block
  - Custom shadows use navy-tinted rgba (15, 23, 42 = slate-900/navy-900)
  - Dark mode was removed - design focuses on light mode for trust/premium feel
  - Font stack includes Inter as primary (to be added in US-002)
- Typography utilities are custom CSS classes (text-display, text-h1, etc.) not Tailwind extensions
- Use `tabular-nums` class for numbers that need alignment (ratings, prices, stats)

## 2026-01-09 - US-002
- What was implemented: Typography refinement with Inter font and typography scale
- Files changed: `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Inter font added via `next/font/google` with weights 400, 500, 600, 700
  - Font variable `--font-inter` applied to body via className in layout.tsx
  - Typography scale uses custom CSS classes: `.text-display`, `.text-h1`, `.text-h2`, `.text-h3`, `.text-body`, `.text-label`
  - Headlines use negative letter-spacing (`--tracking-tight: -0.025em`) for premium feel
  - Labels use wide tracking (`--tracking-wide: 0.05em`) with uppercase transform
  - Body has base 16px with 1.5 line-height set on body element
  - `.tabular-nums` class uses `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for number alignment
